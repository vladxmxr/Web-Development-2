	<h3> I know a lot of people who watch my Instagram stories are always like "How on earth did you do that?!" Simple, it's called Nichi.</h3>
	<p>Nichi is an app that includes various different templates, that all fit a typical iPhone screen. It also features it's own stickers, filters, fonts and backgrounds, making it easier <br> to make a collage. Nichi is also available for Android.</p>

  <h3>"Omg your Instagram is like SOOO cool, <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what do you use to edit?"</h3>
  <p>Well <em>HONEY</em> I'm glad you asked.
	<br>
	<br>
  When I take photos for my Instagram, <br> sometimes I would get into these really <br>weird moods where I'm like "Oooh! <br>Definitely going to change up my eye colour, <br>drop 25kg, smoothen out my ENTIRE skin" <br>and so on and so forth, that's old Vlad. New <br>Vlad likes to go 'au natural', where all I do is <br>put a filter on my photo and alter the exposures, <br>contrast, sharpening, and adding grain. I would <br>go through different phases of using HB2, to C8, <br>to J2(to all my fellow VSCO cam queens who <br>understand my lingo, I love you)... basically I <br>could never stick to the one filter. Lately I've <br>discovered just using A6 because it's such a nice <br>filter for more natural looks (depending how <br>natural you wanna go). As you can see here to <br>the left, there is the original photo on top, and <br>the edited on the bottom, and I have provided <br>my VSCO preset to achieve this filter to the right <br>(you are so totally welcome by the way).</p>

	<h3>So how exactly DO I whiten, add <br> detailing, smoothen my skin, etc.?</h3>
	<p>As shown on the left, you can see the original, the <br>whitened version, and then a whitened and edited <br>version. In order to achieve this look, I use FaceTune <br>(if you have not heard of this app before, stop reading <br>now, go out and breathe in some fresh 2019 air and re-<br>evaluate all your life choices IMMEDIATELY). FaceTune <br>has plenty of options, such as a re-sizing tool, a tones tool, <br>a patch tool and so on and so forth. Although this app is a whopper €4.49, it is probably the best iPhone app to use <br>for editing (although you can do all of this on photoshop <br>but who really wants to pay €20 a month for it??) For this photo in particular, I used the whitening tool to whiten the <br>background and my shirt, and I used the detailing tool to highlight my necklace and some of my moles. I then went onto VSCO cam and used the preset shown on the left-hand screen (no, I did not copy any of my filters from online, <br>I swear, please believe me).</p>

	<h3>And how DID I edit my Paris photos?</h3>
	<p>Well of course I used VSCO Cam for the filters (I used M5, for <br>these photos), adjusted the contrast, exposure and grain ever so <br>slightly, but how did I add those beautiful quotes? (I robbed them <br>from a Bratz-inspired Instagram page, please don't tell my momma, <br>she loves those quotes). Using the Helvetica-Neue font on the app <br>'phonto', changing the colour to yellow and adjusting the thickness <br>and shadowing of the font, I placed the text at the bottom of the pictures <br>before adding any other tweaks. As seen above for the rainbow effect, I <br>used a prism while photographing. All images were taken on my iPhone 8 <br>(who even needs a DSLR camera nowadays??)</p>
