	<h2>My name is Vladimir Marcuta, I am 18 years old and a social media/shopping addict.</h2>
	<p> My love for social media began in 2012 through Instagram and Voto. Voto was an app used to post a poll and use up to 4 photos for everybody <br> to vote on (hence the name sounding like Vote-oh!) Somehow little twelve year old me would spam the app with different (and pretty pointless <br> polls) and make it to the featured page. every. time. Sometimes I would get a couple of hundred votes, other times 5000 other people would have <br> voted, boy was I a famous little Voto-ian (is that what they're called???)
	<br>
	<br>
	Then came my shopping addiction (oh boy). With the rise of social media and Instagram bloggers/vloggers careers skyrocketing around the same <br> time I discovered voto, influenced me to go through different phases of clothing. Of course I peaked my modelling career when I strutted around <br> in my 'Thomas the Tank Engine' merch through my toddler years, but then came a more dark period in my life where all I wore was BLACK (no <br>I was not emo, I just so happened to wear everything black and listen to Evanescence every once in a while, please don't judge me). So those were <br> my toddler and younger teenage years but what do I wear now? Moving schools and where I lived at the age of 15, I ended up getting a new set <br>of friends who are ALL. ABOUT THE GAYS. So here came my Aliexpress phase, where all I ordered was very low quality clothing and somehow <br>turned it into high end fashion (don't know how, but trust me I made it work). I finally realised after a year or two that Aliexpress was NOT. WORTH. <br> IT (why did it take me that long? I do not know). Now I focus on more sustainable or minimalistic fashion. Only recently has my obsession for <br>charity shopping PEAKED and still continues to this day (I mean who doesn't want to find branded clothing at a fraction of the price???)
